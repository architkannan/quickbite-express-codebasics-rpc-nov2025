## ❗ The Problem

In June 2025, **QuickBite Express**, a Bengaluru-based food delivery startup, was hit by a *dual crisis*:
1. A viral **food-safety incident** at partner restaurants  
2. A **week-long monsoon-driven delivery outage**

The fallout was immediate:

- Fulfilled orders **collapsed by ~71%**  
- Customer ratings fell from **4.5 → 2.5**  
- Loyal & high-value customers disengaged almost entirely  
- Partner restaurants shifted activity to competitors  
- CAC surged as organic acquisition dried up  

Management needed a **single source of truth** to understand:
- What failed  
- How customers reacted  
- Which cities and segments to prioritize  
- What operational fixes were essential  
- How to rebuild trust and reactivate demand  

---

## 📝 Overview

This Power BI project explores four core dimensions of the crisis:

1. **Crisis Diagnostics** – Structural, operational, and emotional failure points  
2. **Customer Behaviour Shift** – How and why customers disengaged  
3. **Geographic & Partner Insights** – Stability, risk zones, and partner reactions  
4. **Recovery Blueprint** – Fix reliability, rebuild trust, and target customers with high ROI  

**Goal:**  
Enable leadership to understand the crisis in minutes and act with clarity —  
**“Fix reliability → rebuild trust → reactivate the right customers.”**

**Deliverables:**

- **Executive Dashboard** with  
  - City-level demand shock analysis  
  - Delivery performance KPIs  
  - Cancellation & SLA diagnostics  
  - Sentiment and review insights  
  - Segment-level revenue at risk  
  - Restaurant performance patterns  
  - Competitive benchmarking (Swiggy & Zomato)  

- **Strategic Recovery Framework** covering  
  - Operational repair blueprint  
  - Brand trust recovery  
  - Customer reactivation strategy  
  - 6–12 week recovery targets

## 🔢 Data Sources

Primary datasets came from the Codebasics challenge, along with structured logic and external research.

1. **Orders Data** – Subtotal, discounts, delivery fee, timestamps, cancellation status  
2. **Customer Data** – Activity change %, value tier, order history  
3. **Restaurant Data** – Partner type, cuisine, activity by phase  
4. **Date Tables** – Pre-crisis vs crisis period segmentation  
5. **External sources:**  
   - Swiggy & Zomato **shareholder letters** (Food delivery: GOV, Monthly Transacting Users, Monthly Transacting Restaurant Partners)  
   - Public reporting to contextualize crisis timeline

## 🚀 Solution: Dashboard & Analytics

A Power BI dashboard was designed to walk leadership through the entire story — from shock to recovery.

### Tools & Techniques
- Power BI (DAX, bookmarks, field parameters, word cloud visual)  
- Power Query  
- DAX measures & segmentation logic

## 📊 Dashboard Structure & Insights

| Dashboard Component | Key Insight |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **KPI Cards** | Orders & NOV dropped ~71%; AOV stable → customers didn’t downshift, they exited. |
| **Delivery Performance Trends** | Delivery time rose 39.5 → 60 mins; SLA fell from 46% to 14%. |
| **Cancellation Analysis** | Cancellations doubled, indicating operational instability. |
| **City-Level Decline** | Declines clustered tightly (~69–72%) → platform-wide trust failure. |
| **High-Volume Restaurant Decline** | Trusted partners dropped 85–92% → not supply-driven; trust-driven. |
| **Customer Mix Stability** | Order distribution across cities, cuisine, partner type remained unchanged. |
| **Sentiment Analysis** | Ratings collapsed from 4.5 → 2.5; cold food + soggy packaging dominated complaints. |
| **Demand Shock Severity Matrix** | Delhi stable; Mumbai/Bengaluru recoverable; Pune/Hyderabad monitor; Kolkata/Ahmedabad high risk. |
| **Customer Segmentation** | Fence Sitters + High-Value Recoverable = 80% of recovery ROI. |
| **Competitive Benchmarking** | Swiggy & Zomato operate at massive scale (based on shareholder letters). |
| **CAC Surge Analysis** | Organic acquisition collapsed; paid became dominant → higher CAC. |

## 🧠 Key Strategic Insights

### **1. Operational breakdown triggered customer exit**  
SLA failures → delays → cold food → dissatisfaction → churn.

### **2. Emotional distrust drove abandonment**  
Ratings crash showed this was not about convenience — it was a **trust breach**.

### **3. High-value & loyal customers disengaged the hardest**  
Their exit is the strongest indicator of brand damage.

### **4. Crisis impacted every metro equally**  
Declines were uniform — this was not a local issue.

### **5. Supply-side changes did not drive loss**  
Customer mix stayed stable; the issue was demand, not restaurant availability.

## 🛠 Strategic Recovery Blueprint

### **A. Operational Repair**
- Improve SLA accuracy & routing  
- Sync kitchen prep with rider pickup  
- Strengthen rider incentives  
- Build proactive service recovery (auto credits, delay alerts)  
- Upgrade packaging for temperature-sensitive items  

### **B. Brand & Trust Recovery**
- “Safe Kitchen” badges + hygiene audits  
- Transparent reliability metrics in-app  
- Hot & Fresh guarantee for key cuisines  
- Trust-focused communication and city narratives  

### **C. Customer Reactivation (Segment-Based)**

| Segment | Why It Matters | Strategy |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Fence Sitters** | Largest revenue at risk | Light incentives + reliability messaging |
| **High-Value Recoverable** | Highest ROI | Personal outreach, premium support, Safe Kitchen mapping |
| **Light Users** | Low LTV | Automated, low-cost engagement |
| **Unrecoverable** | Low ROI | No targeted spend |

## ✔️ Conclusion

This project demonstrates my ability to:

1. Diagnose operational, behavioural, and sentiment failures using data  
2. Build an analytics story that explains *what happened* and *why*  
3. Connect insights to strategic, ROI-driven recommendations  
4. Design executive-ready dashboards and recovery frameworks
